        <p>GAME+SIEVE is an alternative for people who enjoy watching gameplay videos that provides an easy search environment. After users search for their favorite video games, they are able to sort by commentary language, subject of videos and much more. GAME-SIEVE not only makes finding gaming videos easier, it also allows its users to rate Youtube channels, get the best gameplay suggestions first and it presents the highly requested “commentary filter”.

          To build this web application I used HTML, CSS, JQuery/Javascript, the IGN API and the Youtube API. I wrote down a list of features I wanted my app to have, how long they should take to complete, then organized them by priority. With this in mind, I was able to write and deploy the application in time without being distracted by unimportant features.</p>
